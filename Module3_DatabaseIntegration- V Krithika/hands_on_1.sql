##Task 2

-- 1NF also known as the First Normal Form, is property of a relation in a RDBMS. 
-- It ensures that no column contains multiple values in any row and that each column contains atomic values.
--In other words, each column should contain only one value per row, and each row should be unique. And here all the tables created above are in 1NF.

-- 2NF is known as the Second Normal Form where all non-ket attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
-- In the enrollments table, the candidate key is (student_id, course_id)
-- so they depend on both student_id and course_id together. There are no partial dependencies.

-- 3NF is known as the Third Normal Form. There are no transitive dependencies in the table.
-- grade and enrollment_date depend directly on the enrollment record.
-- No non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

## Task 3

alter table students add column phone_number VARCHAR(15); 

alter table courses add column max_seats Int default 60;

alter table enrollments add constraint chk_grade check (grade in ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') OR grade is null);

alter table departments rename column hod_name to head_of_dept;

alter table students drop column phone_number;
